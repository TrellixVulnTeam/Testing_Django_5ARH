1. handles URLs yelp.com -- codingforentrepreneurs.com/projects/30-days-python
2. Returns responses relted to the URL
3. Remebers things

does this through apps, which are self contained (similar to modules) inside a Django project.

accounts -- user "django app"
videos -- 'django app' 
analytics
menu listings

because everything is handled in URLs, need to put view into a URL (therefore go to urls.py in settings)
shouldn't have too much logic in the template file, most should be in the view.py
